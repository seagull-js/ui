# Seagull UI

This project collects react components used within websites for
[The Seagull Framework](https://seagull.technology).

## Storybook

All components are written, documented and tested through a tool called
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). The preview is automatically deployed
to [GitHub Pages](http://seagull-js.github.io/ui) on every commit.
